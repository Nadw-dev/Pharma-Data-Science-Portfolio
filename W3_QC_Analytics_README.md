##  Week 3 – Pharmaceutical QC Data Analytics (Beginner Project)

###  What this project is about
In this project, I worked with a small pharmaceutical QC-style dataset that included:
- Assay %
- Moisture %
- Yield %
- Pass/Fail results

My goal was to explore the data, understand what makes batches pass or fail, and think like someone working in a real pharmaceutical manufacturing or CMC environment.

###  What I learned and practiced
- Using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**
- Loading and exploring QC data
- Summarizing batch performance
- Comparing Pass vs Fail results
- Thinking about GMP/quality rules in a practical way

---

###  What I actually built
✔️ A QC batch dataset  
✔️ Basic data exploration and summaries  
✔️ A comparison of Pass vs Fail batches  
✔️ A simple **rule-based QC engine** that can automatically flag:
- Assay OOS
- High Moisture
- Low Yield

✔️ A plot showing how Yield behaves in different batches

---

### Simple Interpretation
From this project, I saw that batches with higher moisture and lower yield tend to be riskier and more likely to fail.  
The simple QC rule engine helped automatically identify batches that may need investigation, similar to what happens in real pharmaceutical manufacturing environments.

### Tools Used
