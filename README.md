## W3 - Pharmaceutical QC Risk Analytics (Python)

In this project, I analyzed pharmaceutical batch Assay %, Moisture %, and Yield % using Python.  
I built an automated QC evaluation engine, classified batches by risk level, identified high-risk failures, and created a QA investigation summary similar to real GMP environments.

**Skills:** Python, Pandas, Data Analysis, CMC / GMP Reasoning  
**Outputs:** Risk classification, investigation table, CSV QA report
